                                    README FOR THE VENDOR_ST-ERICSSON_U8500 SOURCES

READ THE FOLLOWING TEXT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THESE SOURCES:

These sources are leaked sources downloaded from XDA-Developers forums. Although most of the sources are Apache v2 licensed, there are some crucial parts which are proprietary. The legal status of these sources are yet unknown as ST-Ericsson does not exist now & both ST-Microelectronics as well as Ericsson has failed to respond to any query regarding the usage of these sources.

HENCE, IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF THE LEGALITY OF THESE SOURCES, PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM. 

I WILL CONTINUE TO HOST THESE SOURCES UNTIL ST-Microelectronics OR Ericsson SENDS ME A TAKEDOWN NOTICE.
